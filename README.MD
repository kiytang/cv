# Kiy-Hong Tang

I am an aspiring web developer based in London. Most recently I decided to explore the technical aspects required in modern day software development by enrolling into [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a intensive 12 week software development course. 

The course has allowed me to accumulate a strong foundation and I am now looking for projects and opportunities where I can continue to write clean code and be challenged.
